- Start at the middle (full grid search, weed out half with partial opt.)
	- Weed out those one stddev. above avg.
	@ 10? left do full opt.
	- Store best solutions, analyze pattern, discard very close solutions
		- Use these best solutions for second round for bad apples before trying grid
			search
	- Don't touch edges until center (14 -> N-14) is complete
		- Allow higher limits (dont waste CPU time)
			- scaling up going towards the edge
	- Go outtwards (symm.) skipping 1 res. each (unless small system)
		- Do simple opt. using middle res. values
			- For bad SSDs start partial grid search, grid extends out utils SSD below limit
	- Remaining half use pascal triangle to estimate tau and S, & simp. optimization
		- Again grid search for bad apples
